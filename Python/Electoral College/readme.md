This program is an electoral college calculator. Using two text files it determines the winner. One dictionary will indicate the number of electors per state; the other will assign a hypothetical winning party ("R" or "D") to each state. Using those two dictionaries to determine who would win a presidential election based on the outcome of voting in each state. By modifying the contents of the file that assigns a party to each state, you can experiment with different potential outcomes. (The initial outcomes listed in the file are the outcomes of the 2016 presidential election.)

This program runs from the terminal with two .csv files as parameters.
